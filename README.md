This React Project is the front end app for the KSP Gym Portal. 

This web app will allow users to create, delete, and update workouts for the gym. They will be displayed on a TV by utilizing a raspberry pi. The workouts are time based and the raspberry pi will display the correct workout for that time of the day.
